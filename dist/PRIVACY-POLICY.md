# üîí Privacy Policy for Loops Extension

## The Short Version (TL;DR)

We don't collect, store, or spy on anything. Your data stays with you. Period.

## The Slightly Longer Version

**Data Storage:** All your saved tabs and settings live locally on your device. We don't have servers, databases, or any fancy infrastructure to store your stuff.

**Chrome Sync:** If you choose to enable Chrome sync, your data syncs through Google's Chrome infrastructure using your own Google account. We just piggyback on their system - we don't see or store anything.

**GitHub Gists:** If you choose to enable GitHub sync, your data gets stored in YOUR own GitHub gists using YOUR GitHub token. Again, we're just the messenger - we don't see, store, or have access to your GitHub data.

**What We Don't Do:**

- ‚ùå No tracking pixels
- ‚ùå No analytics
- ‚ùå No phone-home features
- ‚ùå No data collection
- ‚ùå No ads or monetization
- ‚ùå No selling your data (because we don't have it!)
- ‚ùå No "oops we got hacked" emails (because there's nothing to hack)

**What We Do:**

- ‚úÖ Help you manage your tabs
- ‚úÖ Store your data locally on YOUR device
- ‚úÖ Optionally sync through YOUR accounts (Chrome/GitHub)
- ‚úÖ Mind our own business

**Questions?**
If you have privacy concerns, you can:

1. Check our open source code on GitHub
2. Use the extension without any sync (everything stays local)
3. Only use Chrome sync (no third-party services)

**The Legal Bit:**
This extension processes tab URLs and titles solely for the purpose of saving and organizing them for you. All data remains under your control through your chosen sync providers (Google Chrome and/or GitHub). We have no access to, control over, or responsibility for data stored through these services.

**Changes to This Policy:**
We'll update this if we ever change how the extension works (spoiler: we probably won't, because local-first is the best).
