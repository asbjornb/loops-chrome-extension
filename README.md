| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+W` - Close tab            | `Alt+R` - Save to Read Later & close         |
| `Ctrl+Tab` - Next tab           | `Alt+T` - Save to Tasks & close              |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` - Previous tab | `Alt+Shift+R` - Save to Read Later with note |
| `Ctrl+Shift+A` - Search tabs    | `Alt+Shift+T` - Save to Tasks with note      |

### Default Loops Shortcuts (Pre-configured)

| Shortcut      | Action                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `Alt+R`       | Save current tab to Read Later list (and close it) |
| `Alt+T`       | Save current tab to Tasks list (and close it)      |
| `Alt+Shift+R` | Save to Read Later with a custom note              |
| `Alt+Shift+T` | Save to Tasks with a custom note                   |

### Additional Commands (Configure Manually)

The extension popup can be opened with a custom shortcut:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
2. Find "Loops" and set a shortcut for **"Activate the extension"** (e.g., `Alt+E`)

**Notes:**

- If `Alt+Shift+T` doesn't work, it may conflict with another extension. You can reassign it in `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
- To close tabs, just use Chrome's built-in `Ctrl+W` shortcut
